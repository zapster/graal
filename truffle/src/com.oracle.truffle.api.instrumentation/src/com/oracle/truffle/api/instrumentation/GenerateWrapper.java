/**
 * Generates a default wrapper subclass of an annotated {@link InstrumentableNode} subclass. The
 * generated subclass is has the same class name as the original class name plus the 'Wrapper'
 * suffix. The generated class has default package visibility. All non-final and non-private methods
 * starting with execute are overridden by the generated wrapper. The generated overrides notifies
 * execution events as required by {@link ProbeNode probes}. Other abstract methods are directly
 * delegated to the wrapped node. No other methods are overridden by the generated wrapper. At least
 * one method starting with execute must be non-private and non-final. Every execute method must
 * have {@link VirtualFrame} as the first declared parameter.
 * <p>
 * <b>Example Usage:</b>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;GenerateWrapper
 * abstract class ExpressionNode extends Node implements InstrumentableNode {
 *
 *     abstract Object execute(VirtualFrame frame);
 *
 *     &#64;Override
 *     public WrapperNode createWrapper(ProbeNode probeNode) {
 *         return new ExpressionNodeWrapper(this, probeNode);
 *     }
