 * <h1>Truffle Tutorial: The Graal Compiler</h1>
 * <div id="contents">
 *
 * This 3-hour tutorial presents Graal, the high-performance dynamic compiler for Java written in Java
 * that enables very high performance for Truffle-implemented languages.
 * The tutorial was presented February 8, 2015 at the International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization
 * (<a href="http://cgo.org/cgo2015/">CGO 2015</a>) and covers the following topics:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Key distinguishing features of Graal</li>
 * <li>Introduction to the Graal IR: basic properties, instructions, and optimization phases</li>
 * <li>Speculative optimizations: first-class support for optimistic optimizations and deoptimization</li>
 * <li>Graal API: separation of the compiler from the VM</li>
 * <li>Snippets: expressing high-level semantics in low-level Java code</li>
 * <li>Compiler intrinsics: use all your hardware instructions with Graal</li>
 * <li>Using Graal for static analysis</li>
 * <li>Custom compilations with Graal: integration of the compiler with an application or library</li>
 * <li>Graal as a compiler for dynamic programming languages in the Truffle framework</li>
 * </ul>
