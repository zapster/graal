            This is an add-on, non-normative documentation describing
            how to use the
            <a href="../package-summary.html">Truffle Debugger API</a> - e.g.
            how to create your own debugger frontend for any
            <a href="../../TruffleLanguage.html">Truffle language</a>
            implementation.

        <h3>Should I request a
            <a href="../DebuggerSession.html">DebuggerSession</a>
            as late or as early as possible?

        <p>
            Creating an empty
            <a href="../DebuggerSession.html">DebuggerSession</a>
            without
            <a href="../Breakpoint.html">breakpoints</a>
            and no suspensions will not cause any peak
            performance degradation. It will however create wrappers for
            statements that were executed once.
            This means that having a debugger session open
            will cause overhead in memory consumption and
            first-execution/interpreter performance.
            If there is a chance that the session will not be used,
            then I would open it as late as possible.
            If you are going to need it anyway,
            then I would open it as early as possible.

        <h3>
        Can I use multiple
            <a href="../DebuggerSession.html">sessions</a>

        different entities actors/threads/etc. separately from each other?
        </h3>
        <p>
            It might not make much sense to have multiple interactive
            debugging sessions, but the debugging framework is not limited to
            interactive debugging. Also automated tools that use the
            debugging framework can coexist with an interactive debugger.
            That's what sessions were designed for.
            Also since the <a href="../Debugger.html">Debugger</a>
            is a singleton for a
            <a href="../../vm/PolyglotEngine.html">PolyglotEngine</a>,
            we isolate users from each other using sessions.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Should I create a session for each actor when I instantiate one?
        </h3>
        <p>
            You should use only one session, but register multiple
            <a href="../Breakpoint.html">breakpoints</a>
            with different conditions that scope your breakpoint.
            You can use
            <a href="../SuspendedEvent.html#getBreakpoints--">SuspendedEvent.getBreakpoints()</a>
            to find out which breakpoints were actually hit.
