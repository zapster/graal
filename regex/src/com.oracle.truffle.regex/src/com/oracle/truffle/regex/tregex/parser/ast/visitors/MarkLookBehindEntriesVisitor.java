/**
 * For all lookbehind assertions, mark all states where the assertion may begin. If an assertion may
 * begin before the root of the AST, the AST is wrapped into a non-capturing group and prepended
 * with a sequence of optional and non-optional any-char matchers, as shown in the following
 * example: /(?<=ab)/ is transformed to /(?:[_any_][_any_](?:|[_any_](?:|[_any_])))(?<=ab)/. The
 * sequence of non-optional any-char matchers is called "prefix", and is necessary for cases where
 * we want to start searching for a regex match on a random position in a string. When starting on
 * any other index than 0, we decrease the index by the length of the prefix (but stop at position
 * 0) and thereby guarantee that lookbehind matches are found, but no regex match prior to the
 * actual starting index is found. When starting at index 0, the prefix is ignored. When starting at
 * index 1, just the last element of the prefix is used, and so on.
 * <p>
 * This entire mechanism assumes that all lookbehind assertion have a fixed length!
