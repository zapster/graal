/**
 * A polyglot context for Graal guest languages that allows to {@link #eval(Source) evaluate} code
 * and exchange symbols.
 *
 * <h4>Sample Usage</h4>
 *
 * Evaluate a fragment of Javascript code with a new context:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Context.create().eval("js", "42")
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h4>Context Creation and Disposal</h4>
 *
 * Create a default context with the static method {@link #create(String...)}, which optionally
 * specifies the languages that may be used in the context. Create a context with custom
 * configuration by using a {@linkplain #newBuilder(String...) builder}. The builder can configure
 * input, error and output streams, both engine and context options, and application arguments.
 * <p>
 * A context that is no longer needed should be {@linkplain #close() closed} to guarantee that all
 * allocated resources are freed. Contexts are {@link AutoCloseable} for use with the Java
 * {@code try-with-resources} statement.
 *
 * <h4>Language Initialization</h4>
 *
 * Each Graal language performs some initialization in a context before it can be used to execute
 * code, after which it remains initialized for the lifetime of the context. Initialization is by
 * default lazy and automatic, but it can be {@link Context#initialize(String) forced}.
 * <p>
 *
 * <h4>Evaluation</h4>
 *
 * <h4>Values</h4>
 *
 * See {@link Value}
 *
 * <h4>Symbol Exchange</h4>
 *
 * After evaluating code that creates top-level named values, a context can be used to
 * {@link #lookup(String, String) lookup} these symbols using their name.
 * <p>
 * Each context provides access to a shared (global) collection of polyglot <em>symbols</em> that
 * can be {@link #importSymbol(String) imported} and {@link #exportSymbol(String, Object) exported}
 * with the symbol name.
 *
 * <h4>Interoperability</h4>
 *
 * <h4>Exception Handling</h4>
 *
 * Most context methods throw {@link PolyglotException} when errors occur in guest languages.
 *
 * <h4>Proxies</h4>
 *
 * <h4>Isolation</h4>
 *
 * Each context is by default isolated from all other instances with respect to both language
 * evaluation semantics and resource consumption. Contexts can be optionally
 * {@linkplain Builder#engine(Engine) configured} to share a single underlying engine; see
 * {@link Engine} for more details about sharing.
 *
 * <h4>Thread-Safety</h4>
 *
 * A context permits guest language code evaluation on only one thread at a time, but it need not
 * always be the same thread. An attempt to execute code in a context where an evaluation is
 * currently underway will fail with an {@link IllegalStateException}.
 * <p>
 * Meta-data from the context's underlying {@link #getEngine() engine} can be retrieved safely by
 * any thread at any time.
 * <p>
 * A context may be {@linkplain #close() closed} from any thread, but only if the context is not
 * currently executing code. If a context is currently executing code, a different thread can kill
 * the execution and close the context using {@link #close(boolean)} .
 *
