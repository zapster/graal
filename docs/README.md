GraalVM is a project based in Oracle Labs developing a new JIT Compiler and Polyglot Runtime for the JVM.
Further details can be found on the [OTN site](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oracle-labs/program-languages/overview/index.html).

[Truffle](https://github.com/graalvm/graal/blob/master/truffle/README.md) is a framework for implementing languages as simple interpreters and forms the basis of the Polyglot Runtime. The official Truffle documentation is maintained as [Truffle javadoc](http://graalvm.github.io/graal).

[Graal](https://github.com/graalvm/graal/blob/master/compiler/README.md) is a dynamic compiler written in Java that integrates with the HotSpot JVM. It has a focus on high performance and extensibility. In addition, it provides optimized performance for Truffle-based languages running on the JVM.
