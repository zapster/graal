/**
 * Node used to convert unknown value objects, e.g., objects that resulted from a low level memory
 * read, i.e., word-to-object reads, to a proper object. This node needs to be inserted in the right
 * place by the analysis client.
 *
 * By default during analysis all objects that result from low level reads are treated as having
 * unknown value. We only convert them to proper objects when they are used as a receiver object in
 * calls, loads, stores, etc. Thus, objects that are never used as proper Java objects, but only
 * passed around as data will not interfere with the points-to analysis. If an unknown value object
 * is used as a proper object, for example as a receiver for a call, an unsupported feature will be
 * reported.
 *
 * The stamp of the node is used to reduce the type of the return value from the all instantiated
 * types to the type subtree of the specified type. If the type is Object no actual type reduction
 * is done.
