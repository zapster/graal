 * We want the {@link DynamicHub} to be immutable at run time, so we cannot use it for
 * synchronization operations. So we need a different object to synchronize on when a static method
 * is declared synchronized. We use the class {@link ClassSynchronizationTarget}, which is not used
 * for anything else.
 *
 * For "static synchronized" methods, the class is a compile time constant, so the new target is
 * also a compile time constant. We could do the {@link #synchronizationTargets lookup} also at run
 * time when we detect synchronization on a {@link DynamicHub}, but this is currently not necessary.
 * Instead, we disallow such synchronizations already during native image generation and fail with
 * an unsupported feature error.
