/**
 * This class is the plumbing under java.lang.ref.Reference. Instances of this class are discovered
 * by the collector and put on a list. The list can then be inspected to implement
 * java.lang.ref.Reference-like operations.
 *
 * Instances of DiscoverableReference are treated specially by the collector.
 * <ul>
 * <li>The "referent" field will *not* be followed during live object discovery. It is a Pointer,
 * not an Object.</li>
 * <li>During live object discovery, each DiscoverableReference will be added to the "discovered"
 * list.</li>
 * <li>If the object referenced by the referent field is not live at the end of a collection, the
 * "referent" field will be set to null.</li>
 * <li>If the object referenced by the referent field is live at the end of a collection, the
 * referent field is updated if the object moved.</li>
 * <li>If the object referenced by the referent field is live at the end of a collection, the
 * DiscoverableReference will be removed from the discovered list.</li>
 * </ul>
 * After a collection, anyone who is interested can run down the discovered list and do something
 * with each DiscoverableReference.
 *
 * On top of this, I think you could build PhantomReference and WeakReference classes by adding a
 * getReferent() method that returned the referent as an Object. See {@linkplain FeebleReference}
 * and {@linkplain FeebleReferenceList}. Reference classes that subsequently promote their referent
 * (SoftReference and FinalReference) would be more complicated.
 *
 * All the state that is needed to build lists, etc., is allocated in the DiscoverableReference
 * instances, because space can not be allocated for lists during a collection.
