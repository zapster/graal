This is a JVMTI agent that traces calls to specific JNI functions during the
execution of a Java program. It focuses on functions that look up program
elements, such as FindClass or GetMethodID). A separate Python script parses
the generated trace and generates a configuration file for use with the JNI
implementation of SubstrateVM.

Usage:
  java -agentpath:/path/to/jni-trace-agent.so=/path/to/output-file.txt ...
  ./svmjniconfig.py /path/to/output-file.txt > /path/to/jni-config.json
