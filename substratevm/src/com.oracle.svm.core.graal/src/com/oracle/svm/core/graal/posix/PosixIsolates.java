         * Request an anonymous memory mapping for this isolate's clone of the image heap. The start
         * address of that mapping becomes the isolate's heap base address. We want extra heap
         * chunks that we allocate later to be at a higher address than the heap base so that we can
         * safely consider the base-relative offsets to be unsigned. Therefore, we request the
         * lowest non-zero multiple of the page size as this mapping's address. However, that
         * request is only a hint unless we use MAP_FIXED, which makes things much more complex on
         * our end. Observations:
         *
         * - Without a hint to mmap(), anonymous mappings on Linux 4.4 (openSUSE) on x86_64 are
         * created just before the mapped shared objects, and subsequent mappings are assigned
         * decreasing addresses. However, specifying sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE) as a hint for the first
         * mapping reproducingly places it at a very low address, even before the loaded executable.
         * Therefore, it seems that a number of isolates can be reliably created with their image
         * heap clones at low addresses and with allocated heap chunks at higher addresses.
         *
         * - On Darwin 13.4, anonymous mappings are created after the mapped executable (and some
         * malloc regions in between). Subsequent mappings are assigned increasing addresses that
         * are close to each other. Specifying hints does not have a noticeable effect. Unmapping a
         * mapping makes its address space immediately reusable. Due to the increasing addresses, a
         * single isolate's heap can be safely created. However, because of the address space reuse,
         * a heap chunk of an isolate can be allocated at a lower address than its heap base when
         * another isolate unmaps a chunk at that location.
